# predictive-maintenance
#Problem Statement:
In industry, prognostics and health management are key topics for anticipating asset
state and avoiding downtime and breakdowns. Run-to-Failure simulation data from
turbofan jet engines is included.
The C-MAPSS software was used to simulate engine degradation. Four separate sets
of operational conditions and fault modes were simulated in four different ways. To
characterize fault progression, record numerous sensor channels. The Prognostics CoE
at NASA Ames provided the data set.
The main goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine. RUL is
equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last data point in the
test dataset.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.
