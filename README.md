# predictive-maintenance
#Problem Statement:
In industry, prognostics and health management are key topics for anticipating asset
state and avoiding downtime and breakdowns. Run-to-Failure simulation data from
turbofan jet engines is included.
The C-MAPSS software was used to simulate engine degradation. Four separate sets
of operational conditions and fault modes were simulated in four different ways. To
characterize fault progression, record numerous sensor channels. The Prognostics CoE
at NASA Ames provided the data set.
The main goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine. RUL is
equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last data point in the
test dataset.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

Project Evaluation metrics:

Code:
 You are supposed to write a code in a modular fashion
 Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
 Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
 Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
 Portable: It works the same in every environment (operating system)
 You have to maintain your code on GitHub.
 You have to keep your GitHub repo public so that anyone can check your code.
 Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development.
 You should include basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the readme
file on GitHub
 Follow the coding standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Database:
 You are supposed to use a given dataset for this project which is a Cassandra
database.
 https://astra.dev/ineuron
